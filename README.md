The program reads in a text file containing a list of courses and their prerequisites, then creates a binary search tree data structure to store the courses. It then presents a menu to the user with options to load data from a text file, display a list of all courses, or search for and display a single course and its prerequisites.

Data structures are important to understand because they are the building blocks of computer programs and algorithms. They allow us to store and manipulate data in an organized and efficient way, which is essential for solving many real-world problems.
Understanding data structures allows us to choose the most appropriate structure for a particular task and implement it in a way that is both correct and efficient. This is important because the efficiency of a program can have a big impact on its performance and scalability, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.

Working on this project helped me understand the following:
 - The importance of data structures in software design and development
 - The process of developing a program using a structured approach
 - The use of C++ to implement data structures and algorithms
 - The importance of debugging in software development
 - The value of proper documentation

  The project helped me figure out the importance of writing modular code that is easy to understand, using meaningful variable and function names, following a consistent coding style, and testing my code to ensure it functions correctly.
